# Raspberry pi setup

This is a RPi setup guide and tools which I built for my-self, which you can use it too, I'm been written some guide inside those folders that you can check it out!

## Folders

* `headless_init`: setup your RPi without a monitor or a USB tty cable.
* `setup`: some setup files (not finished yet)
